ðŸŽ® 2D Game Development in C with MLX (MiniLibX)
Created a tile-based 2D game using C and the MiniLibX (MLX) graphics library in a Linux environment. This project showcases event-driven programming and low-level graphics handling.

ðŸ§© Project Highlights:
â€¢ Player navigates a 2D map using W, A, S, D keys
â€¢ Game can be exited via the ESC key or by clicking the window's close (X) button
â€¢ Map loaded from .ber files with real-time rendering and collision detection
â€¢ Includes collectibles, walls, enemies, and an exit point
â€¢ Proper resource management and input handling
â€¢ Separated logic for rendering, movement, and game state

ðŸ›  Technologies & Skills:
â€¢ C programming
â€¢ MiniLibX (graphical and input handling library)
â€¢ Event-driven development
â€¢ Linux-based system programming
â€¢ Low-level graphics and memory management

This project deepened my understanding of how games work behind the scenes and strengthened my ability to build interactive applications in C.
